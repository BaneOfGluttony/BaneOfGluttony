As you step over the rough cobblestone, you hear a quiet sobbing from around the corner. Do you approach the voice?

Whomever it is that is crying, they need help. You rush around the corner and nearly collide with a rather plump mouse as you do so. She gasps momentarily, before ducking her head down and wiping the tears from her snout.
"Please forgive my good [sir/madam]," she starts, "It’s just... I’m so hungry. I have had nothing to eat since second lunch, and I fear I may die of hunger!" Looking over the woman, you note that she isn’t wasting away in any sense of the word. Rather, she appears to be quite overweight! Her hips are starting to fray the fabric of her plain dress, her belly seems to be stretching the threads to their limit, as you can see the downy white fur peaking through the strained garment. Finally, it appears that her breasts have made an impromptu window of the woman’s torso. "If it isn’t too much trouble... could you bring me some food? I don’t have money for the restaurant, but I have just enough for you to buy a simple weapon. There are an enormous number of boars that have cropped up just to the east of the city. If you could bring me five haunches of pork, I’d be ever so grateful!" Her stomach grumbles, and she adds, "The faster, the better!"
Do you accept?

She shakes your hand, thanking you heartily, the various fatty bits of her jiggling furiously as she does so. "Oh... I’m Shara, by the way." She blushes slightly before offering you a handful of gold pieces. "The blacksmith is on the [direction] side of town, just [direction] of the [location]. This should be enough to buy a simple weapon to help you hunt. Thanks again!"

You decide that you have enough problems of your own without having to deal with another’s at the moment. You continue on your way, the sobbing slowly growing fainter as you leave the corner.

She looks rather forlorn, her stomach growling again as she clutches it. "Well, thanks anyway. Have a good day, sir." She wipes her wet snout one more time before ambling away, quickly turning the corner as she leaves.
